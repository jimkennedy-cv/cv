              At <strong>Midokura</strong>, I ship REST API documentation to the external client via a customer-facing
              docs portal that I built, and I oversee internal informational content in the Confluence instance. At
              <strong>OneMind Technologies</strong> I overhauled ad hoc documentation, created new content, and steered
              the company towards a unified knowledge base. For <strong>King Games</strong> I built and managed the
              Confluence instance, recruited and oversaw a team of technical specialists, and built and ran several
              communications channels.

                  As Worldsensing’s first technical writer I devised and implemented a set of Documentation processes
                  and procedures. I initially revised and edited all extant documentation across the company, and then
                  wrote all new documentation and help files based on my identification and assessment of the
                  ‘knowledge gaps.’ Working transversally, and mostly remotely, my overarching mission was to provide a
                  single-point-of-entry for all tribal knowledge. I also translated customer-facing documentation from
                  Spanish to English.

                  Initially I built King's Atlassian Confluence instance, and during the company's explosive growth
                  phase I
                  grew it to become the company's primary repository of shared information. As headcount at the hugely
                  successful games company grew, I scaled the internal wiki accordingly, from a few hundred pages to
                  tens of thousands of pages, blog posts, video presentations, meeting notes, and all games knowledge.
                  King's Confluence is now the company's preeminent knowledge base; it is the first point of contact
                  when
                  seeking information on all internal matters.

                <p>
                  In my leadership role I recruited and directed a team comprising a Confluence expert, a technical
                  administrator, and a technical writer. I also worked to define and evolve a sensible structure of
                  documentation, presentations, and videos. I also curated such content induction material, roadmaps,
                  API descriptions and best practice documentation. My
                  objectives were to prioritise the production of documentation, presentations, best practice guides,
                  tech
                  talks, etc. needed for game teams to understand what is available and how to use it. I built and ran
                  several other communications channels, including HipChat, Slack, Trello, the public-facing tech blog,
                  and social media accounts.

                  building a team, mapping the company's knowledge storage requirements, and delivering a framework
                  for organizing the existing documentation. Managing my team, I evolved the role to create and impose a
                  formal documentation structure based on business requirements, reduce the existing footprint by 50%,
                  and build a scalable architecture for growth.
